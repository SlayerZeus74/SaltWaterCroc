    <h2>Behavior and ecology</h2>
    <p>
        The primary behavior to distinguish the saltwater crocodile from other
        <a href="#">crocodiles</a> is its tendency to occupy salt water. Though other crocodiles
        also have <a href="#">salt glands</a> that enable them to survive in saltwater, a trait
        that alligators do not possess, most other species do not venture out to
        sea except during extreme conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saltwater crocodiles use <a href="#">ocean currents</a> to travel long distances. In
        Australia, 20 crocodiles were tagged with <a href="#">satellite transmitters;</a> 8 of
        them ventured out into <a href="#">open ocean</a>, and one of them traveled 590 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (370
        <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) along the coast in 25 days from the North Kennedy River on the eastern
        coast of <a href="#
        ">Far North Queensland</a>, around <a href="#">Cape York Peninsula</a>, to the west
        coast in the <a href="#">Gulf of Carpentaria</a>. Another individual swam 411 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (255 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>)
        in 20 days. Without having to move around much, sometimes simply by
        floating, the current-riding behaviour allows for the conservation of
        energy. They interrupted their movements and resided in sheltered bays for
        a few days until the current changed direction. Sometimes, they also swam
        up and down <a href="#">river systems</a>. While most crocodilians are social animals
        sharing basking spots and food, saltwater crocodiles are more <a href="#">territorial</a>
        and are less tolerant of their own kind; adult males will share territory
        with females, but drive off rival males. Saltwater crocodiles mate in the
        wet season, laying <a href="#">eggs</a> in a nest consisting of a mound of mud and
        vegetation. The female guards the nest and <a href="#">hatchlings</a> from predators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally very <a href="#">lethargic</a>, a trait that helps it survive months at a time
        without food, the saltwater crocodile will usually loiter in the water or
        bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A
        study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated
        that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water
        during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend
        relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter. Saltwater
        crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians,
        spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much
        less <a href="#">terrestrial</a> than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on
        land except for <a href="#">basking</a>. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in
        search of land and in some cases, <a href="#">barnacles</a> have been observed growing on
        crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.
