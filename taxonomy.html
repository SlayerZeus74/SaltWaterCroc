    <h2>Taxonomy and evolution</h2>
    <i> Crocodilus porosus </i> was the <a href="#">scientific name</a> proposed
    by <a href="#">Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider</a> who described a
    <a href="#">zoological specimen</a> in 1801. In the 19th and 20th centuries,
    several saltwater crocodile specimens were described with the following
    names:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i> Crocodilus biporcatus </i> proposed by <a href="#">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1807 were
        23 saltwater crocodile specimens from India, <a href="#">Java</a> and <a href="#">Timor</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i> Crocodilus biporcatus raninus</i> proposed by <a href="#">Salomon MÃ¼ller</a> and
        <a href="#">Hermann Schlegel</a> in 1844 was a crocodile from <a href="#">Borneo</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Crocodylus porosus</i> australis proposed by <a href="#">Paulus Edward Pieris
            Deraniyagala</a> in 1953 was a specimen from Australia.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Crocodylus pethericki</i> proposed by Richard Wells and C. Ross
        Wellington in 1985 was a large-bodied, relatively large-headed and
        short-tailed crocodile specimen collected in 1979 in the Finnis River,
        <a href="#">Northern Territory</a>. This purported species was later considered to be a
        misinterpretation of the physiological changes that very large male
        crocodiles undergo. However, Wells and Wellington's assertion that the
        Australian saltwater crocodiles may be distinctive enough from northern
        Asian saltwater crocodiles to warrant <a href="#">subspecies</a> status, as could
        raninus from other Asian saltwater crocodiles, has been considered to
        possibly bear validity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Currently, the saltwater crocodile is considered a <a href="#">monotypic</a>
    species.However, based largely on morphological variability, it is thought
    possible that the taxon <i>C. porosus</i> comprises a <a href="#">species complex</a>. Borneo
    crocodile C. raninus specimens can reliably be distinguished both from
    saltwater and <a href="#">Siamese crocodiles</a> (<i>C. siamensis</i>) on the basis of the number
    of ventral scales and on the presence of four postoccipital scutes, which
    are often absent in true saltwater crocodiles.

    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <a href="#">Fossil</a> remains of a saltwater crocodile <a href="#">excavated</a> in northern <a href="#">Queensland</a>
    were dated to the <a href="#">Pliocene</a>. The saltwater crocodile's closest extant
    (living) relatives are the Siamese crocodile and the <a href="#">mugger crocodile</a>. The
    <a href="#">genus</a> <i><a href="#">Crocodylus</a></i> likely originated in Africa and radiated outwards towards
    Southeast Asia and the Americas, although an Australia/Asia origin has also
    been considered.<a href="#"> Phylogenetic</a> evidence supports Crocodylus diverging from
    its closest recent relative, the extinct Voay of Madagascar, around 25
    million years ago, near the <a href="#">Oligocene/Miocene</a> boundary.

    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
    Below is a <a href="#">cladogram</a> based on a 2018 <a href="#">tip dating</a> study by Lee & Yates
    simultaneously using morphological, molecular (<a href="#">DNA sequencing</a>), and
    stratigraphic (fossil age) data, as revised by the 2021 Hekkala et al.
    <a href="#">paleogenomics</a> study using DNA extracted from the extinct <a href="#">Voay</a>.
