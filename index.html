    <h1>Saltwater crocodile</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>saltwater crocodile</b> (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia">crocodilian</a> native
      to <a href="#">saltwater</a> habitats and
      <a href="#">brackish wetlands</a> from <a href="">India</a>'s east coast
      across <a href="#">Southeast Asia </a> and the
      <a href="#">Sundaic region</a> to northern <a href="#">Australia</a> and
      Micronesia. It has been listed as Least Concern on the
      <a href="#">IUCN Red List</a> since 1996. It was hunted for its skin
      throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing
      and <a href="#"> habitat loss</a>. It is regarded as dangerous to humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile and
      <a href="#">crocodilian</a> known.Males grow to a length of up to 6 m (20
      <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), rarely exceeding 6.3 m (21<abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) or a weight of 1,000–1,300 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr>
      (2,200–2,900 <abbr title="pound">lb</abbr>). Females are much smaller and rarely surpass 3 m (10 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>).
      It is also known as the <b>estuarine crocodile</b>,
      <b>Indo-Pacific crocodile</b>, <b>marine crocodile</b>,
      <b>sea crocodile </b> or informally as <b>saltie</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saltwater crocodile is a large and opportunistic
      <a href="#">hypercarnivorous apex predator</a> hypercarnivorous apex
      predator. It <a href="#">ambushes</a> most of its prey and then drowns or
      swallows it whole. It is capable of prevailing over almost any animal that
      enters its territory, including other apex predators such as sharks,
      varieties of freshwater and <a href="#">Saltwater fish</a> including
      pelagic species, <a href="#">invertebrates</a> such as
      <a href="#">crustaceans</a>, various <a href="#">reptiles</a>, birds, and
      <a href="#">mammals</a>, including <a href="#">humans</a>.

    <h2>Taxonomy and evolution</h2>
    <i> Crocodilus porosus </i> was the <a href="#">scientific name</a> proposed
    by <a href="#">Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider</a> who described a
    <a href="#">zoological specimen</a> in 1801. In the 19th and 20th centuries,
    several saltwater crocodile specimens were described with the following
    names:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i> Crocodilus biporcatus </i> proposed by <a href="#">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1807 were
        23 saltwater crocodile specimens from India, <a href="#">Java</a> and <a href="#">Timor</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i> Crocodilus biporcatus raninus</i> proposed by <a href="#">Salomon Müller</a> and
        <a href="#">Hermann Schlegel</a> in 1844 was a crocodile from <a href="#">Borneo</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Crocodylus porosus</i> australis proposed by <a href="#">Paulus Edward Pieris
            Deraniyagala</a> in 1953 was a specimen from Australia.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Crocodylus pethericki</i> proposed by Richard Wells and C. Ross
        Wellington in 1985 was a large-bodied, relatively large-headed and
        short-tailed crocodile specimen collected in 1979 in the Finnis River,
        <a href="#">Northern Territory</a>. This purported species was later considered to be a
        misinterpretation of the physiological changes that very large male
        crocodiles undergo. However, Wells and Wellington's assertion that the
        Australian saltwater crocodiles may be distinctive enough from northern
        Asian saltwater crocodiles to warrant <a href="#">subspecies</a> status, as could
        raninus from other Asian saltwater crocodiles, has been considered to
        possibly bear validity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Currently, the saltwater crocodile is considered a <a href="#">monotypic</a>
    species.However, based largely on morphological variability, it is thought
    possible that the taxon <i>C. porosus</i> comprises a <a href="#">species complex</a>. Borneo
    crocodile C. raninus specimens can reliably be distinguished both from
    saltwater and <a href="#">Siamese crocodiles</a> (<i>C. siamensis</i>) on the basis of the number
    of ventral scales and on the presence of four postoccipital scutes, which
    are often absent in true saltwater crocodiles.

    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <a href="#">Fossil</a> remains of a saltwater crocodile <a href="#">excavated</a> in northern <a href="#">Queensland</a>
    were dated to the <a href="#">Pliocene</a>. The saltwater crocodile's closest extant
    (living) relatives are the Siamese crocodile and the <a href="#">mugger crocodile</a>. The
    <a href="#">genus</a> <i><a href="#">Crocodylus</a></i> likely originated in Africa and radiated outwards towards
    Southeast Asia and the Americas, although an Australia/Asia origin has also
    been considered.<a href="#"> Phylogenetic</a> evidence supports Crocodylus diverging from
    its closest recent relative, the extinct Voay of Madagascar, around 25
    million years ago, near the <a href="#">Oligocene/Miocene</a> boundary.

    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
    Below is a <a href="#">cladogram</a> based on a 2018 <a href="#">tip dating</a> study by Lee & Yates
    simultaneously using morphological, molecular (<a href="#">DNA sequencing</a>), and
    stratigraphic (fossil age) data, as revised by the 2021 Hekkala et al.
    <a href="#">paleogenomics</a> study using DNA extracted from the extinct <a href="#">Voay</a>.

    <h2>description</h2>

    <p>
      The saltwater crocodile has a wide snout compared to most
       crocodiles.
      However, it has a longer <a href="#">snout</a> than the <a href="#">mugger crocodile</a> (<i>C. palustris</i>);
      its length is twice its width at the base. A pair of ridges runs from
      the eyes along the centre of the snout. The scales are oval in shape and
      the <a href="#">scutes</a> are either small compared to other species or commonly are
      entirely absent. In addition, an obvious gap is also present between the
      cervical and dorsal <a href="#">shields</a>, and small, triangular scutes are present
      between the posterior edges of the large, transversely arranged scutes in
      the dorsal shield. The relative lack of scutes is considered an asset
      useful to distinguish saltwater crocodiles in captivity or in illicit
      leather trading, as well as in the few areas in the field where sub-adult
      or younger saltwater crocodiles may need to be distinguished from other
      crocodiles. It has fewer armour plates on its neck than other
      crocodilians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adult saltwater crocodile's broad body contrasts with that of most
      other lean crocodiles, leading to early unverified assumptions the reptile
      was an <a href="#">alligator</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young saltwater crocodiles are pale yellow in colour with black stripes
      and spots on their bodies and tails. This colouration lasts for several
      years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is
      much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes
      apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain
      fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The
      ventral surface is white or yellow in colour in saltwater crocodiles of
      all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do
      not extend onto their bellies. Their tails are grey with dark bands.
    </p>

    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>
      The weight of a crocodile increases approximately cubically as length
      increases (see <a href="#">square–cube law</a>). This explains why individuals at 6 m (20
      ft) weigh more than twice as much as individuals at 5 m (16 ft). In
      crocodiles, linear growth eventually decreases and they start getting
      bulkier at a certain point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saltwater crocodiles are the largest extant <a href="#">riparian</a> predators in the
      world. However, they start life fairly small. Newly hatched saltwater
      crocodiles measure about 28 cm (11 in) long and weigh an average of 71 <abbr title="gram">g</abbr>
      (2.5 oz). These sizes and ages are almost identical to those at average
      sexual maturity in Nile <a href="#">crocodiles</a>, despite the fact that average adult
      male saltwater crocodiles are considerably larger than average adult male
      Nile crocodiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest skull of a saltwater crocodile that could be scientifically
      verified was of a specimen in the <a href="#">Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle</a>,
      collected in <a href="#">Cambodia</a>. Its skull was 76 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (30 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) long and 48 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (19 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>)
      wide near its base, with 98.3 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (38.7 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) long mandibles. The length of
      this specimen is not known, but based on skull-to-total-length ratios for
      very large saltwater crocodiles its length was presumably somewhere in the
      7 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (23 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) range. If detached from the body, the head of a very large
      male crocodile can reportedly weigh over 200 <abbr title="kilogram"><keygen></abbr> (440 <abbr title="pound">lb</abbr>) alone, including
      the large muscles and tendons at the base of the skull that lend the
      crocodile its massive biting strength. The largest tooth measured 9 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr>
      (3.5 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) in length. Other crocodilians have a proportionately longer
      skull, like the gharial (<i>Gavialis gangeticus</i>) and the <a href="#">false gharial</a>
      (<i>Tomistoma schlegelii</i>), but both their skulls and their bodies are less
      massive than in the saltwater crocodile.
    </p>

    <h2>Behavior and ecology</h2>

    <p>
      The primary behavior to distinguish the saltwater crocodile from other
      <a href="#">crocodiles</a> is its tendency to occupy salt water. Though other crocodiles
      also have <a href="#">salt glands</a> that enable them to survive in saltwater, a trait
      that alligators do not possess, most other species do not venture out to
      sea except during extreme conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saltwater crocodiles use <a href="#">ocean currents</a> to travel long distances. In
      Australia, 20 crocodiles were tagged with <a href="#">satellite transmitters;</a> 8 of
      them ventured out into <a href="#">open ocean</a>, and one of them traveled 590 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (370
      <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) along the coast in 25 days from the North Kennedy River on the eastern
      coast of <a href="#
      ">Far North Queensland</a>, around <a href="#">Cape York Peninsula</a>, to the west
      coast in the <a href="#">Gulf of Carpentaria</a>. Another individual swam 411 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> (255 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>)
      in 20 days. Without having to move around much, sometimes simply by
      floating, the current-riding behaviour allows for the conservation of
      energy. They interrupted their movements and resided in sheltered bays for
      a few days until the current changed direction. Sometimes, they also swam
      up and down <a href="#">river systems</a>. While most crocodilians are social animals
      sharing basking spots and food, saltwater crocodiles are more <a href="#">territorial</a>
      and are less tolerant of their own kind; adult males will share territory
      with females, but drive off rival males. Saltwater crocodiles mate in the
      wet season, laying <a href="#">eggs</a> in a nest consisting of a mound of mud and
      vegetation. The female guards the nest and <a href="#">hatchlings</a> from predators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally very <a href="#">lethargic</a>, a trait that helps it survive months at a time
      without food, the saltwater crocodile will usually loiter in the water or
      bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A
      study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated
      that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water
      during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend
      relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter. Saltwater
      crocodiles, however, are among the most active of all crocodilians,
      spending more time cruising and active, especially in water. They are much
      less <a href="#">terrestrial</a> than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on
      land except for <a href="#">basking</a>. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in
      search of land and in some cases, <a href="#">barnacles</a> have been observed growing on
      crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.
