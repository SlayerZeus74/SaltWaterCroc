    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The saltwater crocodile has a wide snout compared to most
         crocodiles.
        However, it has a longer <a href="#">snout</a> than the <a href="#">mugger crocodile</a> (<i>C. palustris</i>);
        its length is twice its width at the base. A pair of ridges runs from
        the eyes along the centre of the snout. The scales are oval in shape and
        the <a href="#">scutes</a> are either small compared to other species or commonly are
        entirely absent. In addition, an obvious gap is also present between the
        cervical and dorsal <a href="#">shields</a>, and small, triangular scutes are present
        between the posterior edges of the large, transversely arranged scutes in
        the dorsal shield. The relative lack of scutes is considered an asset
        useful to distinguish saltwater crocodiles in captivity or in illicit
        leather trading, as well as in the few areas in the field where sub-adult
        or younger saltwater crocodiles may need to be distinguished from other
        crocodiles. It has fewer armour plates on its neck than other
        crocodilians.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adult saltwater crocodile's broad body contrasts with that of most
        other lean crocodiles, leading to early unverified assumptions the reptile
        was an <a href="#">alligator</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young saltwater crocodiles are pale yellow in colour with black stripes
        and spots on their bodies and tails. This colouration lasts for several
        years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is
        much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes
        apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain
        fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The
        ventral surface is white or yellow in colour in saltwater crocodiles of
        all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do
        not extend onto their bellies. Their tails are grey with dark bands.

      <h3>Size</h3>
      <p>
        The weight of a crocodile increases approximately cubically as length
        increases (see <a href="#">square–cube law</a>). This explains why individuals at 6 m (20
        ft) weigh more than twice as much as individuals at 5 m (16 ft). In
        crocodiles, linear growth eventually decreases and they start getting
        bulkier at a certain point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saltwater crocodiles are the largest extant <a href="#">riparian</a> predators in the
        world. However, they start life fairly small. Newly hatched saltwater
        crocodiles measure about 28 cm (11 in) long and weigh an average of 71 <abbr title="gram">g</abbr>
        (2.5 oz). These sizes and ages are almost identical to those at average
        sexual maturity in Nile <a href="#">crocodiles</a>, despite the fact that average adult
        male saltwater crocodiles are considerably larger than average adult male
        Nile crocodiles.

      <p>
        The largest skull of a saltwater crocodile that could be scientifically
        verified was of a specimen in the <a href="#">Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle</a>,
        collected in <a href="#">Cambodia</a>. Its skull was 76 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (30 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) long and 48 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (19 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>)
        wide near its base, with 98.3 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr> (38.7 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) long mandibles. The length of
        this specimen is not known, but based on skull-to-total-length ratios for
        very large saltwater crocodiles its length was presumably somewhere in the
        7 <abbr title="meter">m</abbr> (23 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) range. If detached from the body, the head of a very large
        male crocodile can reportedly weigh over 200 <abbr title="kilogram"><keygen></abbr> (440 <abbr title="pound">lb</abbr>) alone, including
        the large muscles and tendons at the base of the skull that lend the
        crocodile its massive biting strength. The largest tooth measured 9 <abbr title="centimeter">cm</abbr>
        (3.5 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) in length. Other crocodilians have a proportionately longer
        skull, like the gharial (<i>Gavialis gangeticus</i>) and the <a href="#">false gharial</a>
        (<i>Tomistoma schlegelii</i>), but both their skulls and their bodies are less
        massive than in the saltwater crocodile.
